        Arctic Monkeys are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002. The group consists of Alex Turner (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Jamie Cook (guitar, keyboards), Nick O'Malley (bass guitar, backing vocals), and Matt Helders (drums,
        backing vocals). Former band member Andy Nicholson (bass guitar, backing vocals) left the band in 2006 shortly after their debut album was released.
        <br><br>
        Arctic Monkeys were heralded as one of the first bands to come to public attention via the Internet, with commentators suggesting they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed. Their
        debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), became the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history, and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums. It won Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards. The
        band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), also won Best British Album at the 2008 BRIT Awards. They went on to release Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011).
        <br><br>
        The band's global recognition increased with their fifth album AM (2013), which was supported by the global hit "Do I Wanna Know?". AM became their second top 10 album on the US Billboard 200, topped four Billboard charts, and was certified
        platinum in the US. At the 2014 BRIT Awards, the album became their third to win British Album of the Year. Their sixth album, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino (2018), was a major departure from the band's previous guitar-heavy work,
        incorporating psychedelic pop; lounge pop; space pop and glam rock, as well as elements of jazz. It received a Best Alternative Music Album nomination at the 2019 Grammy Awards, their second to do so after Whatever People Say I Am, That's
        What I'm Not.
